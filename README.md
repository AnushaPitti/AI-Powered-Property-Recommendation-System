# AI-Powered-Property-Recommendation-System

This project enhances property recommendations by integrating AI-driven personalization using Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering (SVD algorithm). The key outcomes are:

✅ Personalized Property Suggestions – The system recommends properties based on user preferences like budget, location, and amenities.
✅ Improved User Experience – AI ensures recommendations match evolving market trends and user needs.
✅ Contextual Insights – External data, such as nearby schools, hospitals, and market conditions, enriches property suggestions.
✅ Better Engagement & Decision-Making – Users receive data-driven property recommendations, reducing search time and increasing satisfaction.

By combining dynamic AI models with real-world data, this system creates a smarter, more relevant, and efficient property recommendation experience for users.
